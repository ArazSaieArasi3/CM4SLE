# A systematic reference conceptual model for Software-Led Enterprises (CM4SLE)

## About
A systematic reference conceptual model for Software-Led Enterprises (CM4SLE), based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO).

## Introduction
The CM4SLE (Conceptual Model for Software-Led Enterprises) is a systematic reference conceptual model designed to capture and analyze the architecture of software-led organizations. Grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), this model embeds blockchain-related capabilities into business architecture, highlighting their potential role in enabling organizational agility, ecosystem collaboration, and future-oriented enterprise design. CM4SLE provides both a rigorous theoretical framework and a practical reference point for researchers and practitioners interested in digital transformation, blockchain adoption, and enterprise modeling.

## Note
> **Note:** CM4SLE is an evolving conceptual model that will be refined and extended over time as the research progresses.  
> This repository captures version 1.0 of the model, which represents the current state of development.  
> Users should note that this version may not be complete or entirely free of limitations; future updates will incorporate improvements, extensions, and corrections based on ongoing research and feedback.
